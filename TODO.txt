the goal now is to just get a presentable project
not to create a website 

what are some steps we can take to make this project a presentable cbse project?

i have the answer to that
these are the steps to take:

1. progress

rn we are here (as the great srivathsa claimed)
<------------------|----------------------------->
but we need to be here
<------------------------------------------|----->

but how do we get there?

step 1: making a list of all the work that needs to be done
step 2: doing it.

we are now performing step 1.

LIST OF PRIORITIES
√ add question tags (subject/board)
--> filter questions by question tag/poster
--> OP can mark a question as resolved
--> question sorting system (upvote questions & comments) show hot questions/most upvoted questions
--> edit posts
--> delete posts
--> Flag button {external may ask what to do if someone decides to make obscene comments}
√ user profile page
--> no home page 
--> Moderators can edit tags/delete tags

rahul thinks this is enough. if we have all this, we should have a presentable project
which is a goal
